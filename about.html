    <img src="pictures/launch.jpg" style="width:100%">
      <p>I like software development and I code for fun. I am really interested in aerospace applications for software development, specifically
        energy optimization and guidance are what I would like to research. I am also interested in the broad application of modern software development in looking
        towards future jobs and am open to development in all areas. I am currently looking for software engineering internship opportunities
        as I transition to graduate school full time.
